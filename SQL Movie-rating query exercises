## Q1. Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg. 
select title
from Movie
where director="Steven Spielberg";

## Q2. Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order. 
select distinct year
from Movie m, Rating r
where m.mID=r.mID and (stars= 4 or stars= 5);

## Q3. Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings. 
select title
from Movie 
where mID not in (select distinct mID from Rating)

## Q4. Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 
select name
from Reviewer
where rID in (select rID from Rating where ratingDate is null)

## Q5. Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars.
select name, title, stars, ratingDate
from Movie m, Reviewer re, Rating ra
where m.mID=ra.mID and re.rID=ra.rID
order by name, title, stars

## Q6. For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie. 
select name, title
from Reviewer, Movie
where rID in (select a.rID from Rating a, Rating b where a.rID=b.rID and a.mID=b.mID and a.stars>b.stars and a.ratingDate>b.ratingDate) 
and mID in (select a.mID from Rating a, Rating b where a.rID=b.rID and a.mID=b.mID and a.stars>b.stars and a.ratingDate>b.ratingDate) 

## Q7. For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title. 
select title, stars
from Movie, 
(select mID, max(stars) as stars
from Rating
group by mID) as n
where Movie.mID=n.mID
order by title

## Q8. For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title. 
select title, ratingspread
from Movie, 
(select mID, max(stars)-min(stars) as ratingspread
from Rating
group by mID) as n
where Movie.mID=n.mID
order by ratingspread desc, title

## Q9. Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.) 
select (select avg(avgstar)
from Movie join
(select mID, avg(stars) as avgstar
from Rating
group by mID) as n on Movie.mID=n.mID
where year < 1980)-
(select avg(avgstar)
from Movie join
(select mID, avg(stars) as avgstar
from Rating
group by mID) as n on Movie.mID=n.mID
where year > 1980)

order by h1.grade, h1.name

## Q7. For each student A who likes a student B where the two are not friends, find if they have a friend C in common (who can introduce them!). For all such trios, return the name and grade of A, B, and C.

select *
from Friend f
where f.ID1=l.ID1 and f.ID2=l.ID2)) as n, Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2, Highschooler h3
where f1.ID2=f2.ID1 and n.ID1=f1.ID1 and n.ID2=f2.ID2 and f1.ID1=h1.ID and f1.ID2=h2.ID and f2.ID2=h3.ID

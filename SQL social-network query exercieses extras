from Likes l1, Likes l2, Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2, Highschooler h3
where l1.ID2=l2.ID1 and l1.ID1<>l2.ID2 and l1.ID1=h1.ID and l1.ID2=h2.ID and l2.ID2=h3.ID

## Q2. Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades. 
select h1.name, h1.grade
from Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2, Friend f
where f.ID1=h1.ID and f.ID2=h2.ID 
group by f.ID1
having max(h1.grade=h2.grade)=0

## Q3. What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.) 
select avg(n.ct)
from (select count(*) as ct from Friend group by ID1) as n

## Q4. Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend. 
select count(distinct f1.ID1)
from Friend f1, Friend f2, Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2, Highschooler h3
where f1.ID2=f2.ID1 and f1.ID1=h1.ID and f1.ID2=h2.ID and f2.ID2=h3.ID and h1.name <> "Cassandra" and (h2.name="Cassandra" or 
h3.name="Cassandra")

##. Q5. Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends. 
select name, grade
from Highschooler h, Friend f
where f.ID1=h.ID
group by f.ID1
having count(*) = (select max(ct)
from ( select count(*) as ct
from Highschooler h, Friend f
where f.ID1=h.ID
group by f.ID1))
